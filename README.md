This project provides a Python-based solution for filtering participant data for a research study. The script connects to a SQL database, applies filtering criteria (such as age and consent), and then stores the filtered data back into the database. Additionally, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) is provided to simplify data queries, facilitate new dataset entry, and visualize existing data.
